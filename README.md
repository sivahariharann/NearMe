A lake is a large, naturally occurring body of still water surrounded by land.
 Lakes can form through various natural processes such as glacial activity, volcanic 
 craters, river blockage, or tectonic movements. They vary in size and depth, 
 ranging from small ponds to vast freshwater or saltwater bodies. Lakes play an 
 important role in maintaining ecological balance by supporting a wide range of plants,
  fish, and other aquatic life. They also provide water for drinking, irrigation, industry,
   and recreation. Many lakes are scenic spots that attract tourists and serve as habitats for wildlife. Overall, 
lakes are valuable natural resources that contribute to both the environment and human life.</font>

Stone is a naturally occurring solid material composed of one or more minerals. 
It has been used by humans since ancient times for construction, sculpture, and 
decoration due to its strength, durability, and natural beauty. 
Stones are classified into three main types based on their formation â€” igneous, 
sedimentary, and metamorphic. Common examples include granite, limestone, sandstone,
 marble, and slate. Each type has distinct characteristics that make it suitable for specific purposes. For instance, granite is very hard and used for foundations and bridges, while marble is prized for its decorative appeal in flooring and monuments. Because of its long-lasting nature and aesthetic qualities, stone remains 
one of the most important and widely used natural building materials in the world.</font>

A **temple** is a place of worship and spiritual devotion where people gather to pray,
 meditate, and perform religious rituals. It is often regarded as the dwelling place 
 of a deity or a sacred symbol of faith. Temples are found in many cultures and religions 
 around the world, such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and ancient civilizations like 
 the Greeks and Egyptians. The design and architecture of temples vary widely but are 
 usually built with great artistic and cultural significance, often featuring carvings, 
 sculptures, and symbolic decorations. In addition to being a center for religious 
 activities, a temple also serves as a place of peace, learning, and community gathering, 
 reflecting the values and traditions of the people who worship there.
