A **temple** is a place of worship and spiritual devotion where people gather to pray,
 meditate, and perform religious rituals. It is often regarded as the dwelling place 
 of a deity or a sacred symbol of faith. Temples are found in many cultures and religions 
 around the world, such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and ancient civilizations like 
 the Greeks and Egyptians. The design and architecture of temples vary widely but are 
 usually built with great artistic and cultural significance, often featuring carvings, 
 sculptures, and symbolic decorations. In addition to being a center for religious 
 activities, a temple also serves as a place of peace, learning, and community gathering, 
 reflecting the values and traditions of the people who worship there.
