Stone is a naturally occurring solid material composed of one or more minerals. 
It has been used by humans since ancient times for construction, sculpture, and 
decoration due to its strength, durability, and natural beauty. 
Stones are classified into three main types based on their formation â€” igneous, 
sedimentary, and metamorphic. Common examples include granite, limestone, sandstone,
 marble, and slate. Each type has distinct characteristics that make it suitable for specific purposes. For instance, granite is very hard and used for foundations and bridges, while marble is prized for its decorative appeal in flooring and monuments. Because of its long-lasting nature and aesthetic qualities, stone remains 
one of the most important and widely used natural building materials in the world.</font>
