A lake is a large, naturally occurring body of still water surrounded by land.
 Lakes can form through various natural processes such as glacial activity, volcanic 
 craters, river blockage, or tectonic movements. They vary in size and depth, 
 ranging from small ponds to vast freshwater or saltwater bodies. Lakes play an 
 important role in maintaining ecological balance by supporting a wide range of plants,
  fish, and other aquatic life. They also provide water for drinking, irrigation, industry,
   and recreation. Many lakes are scenic spots that attract tourists and serve as habitats for wildlife. Overall, 
lakes are valuable natural resources that contribute to both the environment and human life.</font>
